v 0.0.16 20230305
* fixed domain input in measurement
* all tests in test_comb.py passed

v 0.0.15 20230221
* fixed int to uint casting
* make_population_amplification implemented

v 0.0.14 20230218
* added SMDCurve object
* implemented epsilon method for SMDCurve
* implemented check method

v 0.0.13 20230216
* implemented make_basic_composition
* fixed int_object_as_slice to catch u32

v 0.0.12 20230214
* fixed an ad-hoc case for tranformation's map
  expecting u32 that does not exists as type in R
  we should think at some method for SEXP2AnyObject
* separated .Rd pages for measurements, transformations
  and chainings (combinations)
* simplified C code. Info is now embdded in the external
  pointer but built in R, no need to build these infos in C. 
  Much easier to extend, in vie of codegen.
* added getInfo() for measurements and transformations
* print method after chain needs fixing (recursive print)
* some memory glitches still happening

v 0.0.11 20230210
* SEX2AnyObject supports tuples
* added return_error to simplify C code
* added print method for Transformations
* some glitches in memory freeing yet (try gc)

v 0.0.10 20230209
* created hashmaps objects as enviroments
  so you can access key, values and have
  $get(key) functionality. These are passed
  to C as is and converted via SEXP2AnyObject
  to the propoer rust object
* Measurements and Transformations converted to
  environments so that newly defined objects
  can call $invoke(data) directly
* SEX2AnyObject and object_as_slice support
  hashmaps. 
  
  
v 0.0.9 - 20230205
* rewrote user interface, now input is R objects
  that are internally transformed in C level
* removed make_randomized_response2
* added combinators:
   make_chain_mt, make_chain_tm, make_chain_tt
   make_pureDP_to_fixed_approxDP
   make_zCDP_to_approxDP
   make_fix_delta
* added measruements:
   export(make_base_laplace)
* added transformations:
   make_bounded_sum
   make_clamp
* added SEXP2 AnyObject and R2C

v 0.0.8 - 20230130
* added R_to_C to mimic python bindings
* added make_randomized_response2 to test R_to_C approach

v 0.0.7 - 20230130
* added make_randomized_response
* added object_to_slice
* reorganized man pages and examples
  for measurement and data

v 0.0.6 - 20230129
* added support for String ans <Vec>String

v 0.0.5 - 20230128
* added proper finalizers for AnyMeasurement and AnyObject
* reorganized a bit the .c files for mdata, measurement and lib load
* fixed the issue with crashing when in R Studio
  related to pointer tag install()-ation
* implemented make_base_gaussian
* changed Measurement class def

v 0.0.3 - 20230110
* first version to support opendp.dylib loading

v 0.0.2 - 20230102
* first version with basic external pointers handling
* createODP, setODP, getODP functions added
* changed package name, dash "-" not allowed in pkg names

v 0.0.1
* simple skeleton
