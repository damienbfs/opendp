In this introduction, we present a differential privacy "Hello World" using OpenDP's Polars API in Python.

For a more conceptual introduction to differential privacy see the :doc:`../theory/index` section,
and for an overview of the OpenDP libraries for Python, R, and Rust see the :doc:`../api/index` documentation.
